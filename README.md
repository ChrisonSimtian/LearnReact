# LearnReact
Just me learning React from Scratch

## Goal
I want to pick up some additional language skills and since we're doing React at work, why not learn React from scratch
This is learning the ins and outs of react in an academic way, learning tricks and hacks and doing things by the book (so having a clean working example for things so that others can pick up on it and learn from my mistakes)

Its also a bunch of dummy projects I can use for other skills like devops and infrastructure, if I quickly need a random project that does something to test something else :D
